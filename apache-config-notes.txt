edit out redirect line
nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

this line makes a permanent redirect to never gonna give you up 
Redirect 301 / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

i think that it being permanent means even if you remove the redirect line then it will still redirect you have to clear the cache to
not be redirected i think that if its just: 
Redirect / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
then it makes a temporary redirect and you dont have to clear the cache to not be directed
if that doesnt work then use 307
